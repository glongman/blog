Tonight I'm attending the [CocoaHeads Ottawa](http://http://www.cocoaheads.org/ca/OttawaGatineauOntario/index.html) meeting.

Will update this as events occur.

> Agenda
>
>  1. Intro to Cappucino: web development with Objective-J
>  2. Tweety10 post-mortem
>  3. and more!

Notes (almost real time):

*   Actually my second visit the first being in October (when I was unemployed :)
*   the group is small (9) and that's great
*   Hmm, wednesday nights is NSCoder night. come and hack. Bridgehead coffee joint - 1277 Wellington Street, Ottawa, 7pm-10pm
* First up, Integrating Web Services with iPhone Apps using Google App Engine.
* Part I - GAE setup.
* hmm, where's Cappucino? OH: presenter isn't here.
* just installed GAE on my MBP.
* and... I'm finished with google app engine. Google wants a mobile number to verify my account.... I don't own a cell phone. FAIL.

Coming Soon (we hope) to the App Store: Tweetie10

My primary takeaway: Interface Builder files (.nib, .xib) should be treated as binary in source control. The folks building Tweetie10 had great grief trying to merge changes in those files.
