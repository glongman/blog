title: An IPhone App Idea
date: 06/02/2010

Tonight I stumbled upon a nice [article](http://blog.indieiphonedev.com/2010/01/27/promoting-your-iphone-app-in-print/) by Tim West. Tim runs the [LogYourRun.com](http://LogYourRun.com) site and had built an iPhone app for it too. In the article, Tim describes how he is using print to market his app by putting a screenshot of it on the back of a business card.

But what caught my eye was this:

> It would be great if apple implemented something similar to the android 
> barcode scanner where all you have to do is take a picture to download 
> an app.  Maybe someone is already working on making such an application for the iPhone.

I think that's a great idea. I wonder if the screenshots that appear in the App Store are easily accessible to all. Some kind of screen scraping I suspect. Image recognition is definitely not my area of expertise but I can see how an app that can do this could be used:

##Scenario 1

John bought this really cool game at the App Store. 

John has coffee with Josh and shows the game to him. Josh wants the game right now.

John holds up his device with the game running. Josh launches the app and points the camera at it.

Boom, the app recognizes the game and boots Josh's device over to the App Store, he buys.

##Scenario 2

Tim has those business cards that include a screenshot of his LogYourRun app on the back side and leaves the cards everywhere that joggers frequent.

Somebody picks up one of Tims' cards and likes the screenshot. They have an iPhone so they fire up this un-named but super app and buy LogYourRun.

##Shazam For Apps

Yes that's exactly what this app would be. [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com/music/web/home.html) for Apps.
